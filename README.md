## TODO
- Traits
  - Hooks/logic that make use of these traits
- Conditions
- Target Reqs
- Valid Targets Selector
- Location Based Choices

- Hooks may be things that don't happen every event. This prevents cluttering of events.
  - units with poison trait take damage at end of turn
  - units with rage trait have cooldown set to 0 after attacking and killing another unit (after battle event)
